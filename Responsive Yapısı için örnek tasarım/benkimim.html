          Hello, I am a 23-year-old young, newly graduated engineer who always
          likes to learn, can keep up with group work and has a team spirit,
          just at the beginning of the road :). Throughout my school life, I
          tried to improve myself by participating in the camps on the udemy
          platform and kodlama.io. As a graduation project, I continued my
          studies on deep learning for about 1 year. I worked as a software test
          engineer internship for 3 months. As a hobby, I started to write
          articles on medium on topics that I am curious about and I continue to
          do so. I love reading books and walking
